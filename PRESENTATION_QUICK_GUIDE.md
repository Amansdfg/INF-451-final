## 📝 Quick Script (5-Minute Version)

### 1. Introduction (30 seconds)
> "I'll demonstrate a multi-agent trading system with three agents that communicate to make automated trading decisions."

### 2. Show Agent Communication (2 minutes)

**Step 1: Market Agent**
- Open "Real-time Simulation"
- Click "Run Agent Cycle"
- Point to Market Agent section: "Market Agent fetched real data from Yahoo Finance"
- Show communication log: "See, it's logged here"

**Step 2: Decision Agent**
- Point to Decision Agent: "Decision Agent used ML model, predicted price, decided BUY"
- Show communication log: "Decision sent to Execution Agent"

**Step 3: Execution Agent**
- Point to Execution Agent: "Execution Agent bought 5 shares"
- Show communication log: "Result sent to UI"

**Say:** "All three agents communicated through the Coordinator, and every message is logged."

### 3. Show Data Flow (1 minute)
- Go to Overview page
- Point to price chart: "Real data from Yahoo Finance"
- Point to indicators: "Technical indicators calculated"
- Go back to Simulation: "This flows to Decision Agent"
- Point to prediction: "ML model predicts price"
- Point to decision: "Decision made based on prediction"

**Say:** "Data flows from market through agents to final execution."

### 4. Show Trade Execution (1 minute)
- Run another cycle
- Show: Market data → Decision → Execution
- Go to Trade History
- Show: Trade in table, P&L chart updated

**Say:** "Complete trade executed and saved to database."

### 5. Show Logs/UI (30 seconds)
- Show all pages briefly:
  - Overview: "Real-time data"
  - Simulation: "Agent execution"
  - Trade History: "Complete history"
  - Database Status: "Data management"

**Say:** "Comprehensive interface with complete logging."

## ⚠️ Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue:** Model not trained → predictions random
**Solution:** Train model first, or explain it's for demonstration

**Issue:** No trades in history
**Solution:** Run a few cycles first

**Issue:** Slow data loading
**Solution:** Explain it's fetching real data from internet

**Issue:** Error in cycle
**Solution:** Show error handling, explain what happened

## 📊 What Numbers to Mention

- **3 Agents:** Market, Decision, Execution
- **16 Features:** Extracted for ML model
- **2% Threshold:** For BUY/SELL decisions
- **10% Balance:** Used for BUY orders
- **50% Holdings:** Sold on SELL decision
- **R² Score:** 0.85-0.92 (model accuracy)
- **Cycle Time:** < 5 seconds
